These meetings, part of a larger series involving tech giants like Broadcom and Nvidia, were centered around crucial topics in European digital regulation, especially the implications of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and broader competition policies. In her discussions with Apple&#39;s Tim Cook, Vestager addressed the necessity for Apple to allow apps to be distributed beyond its proprietary AppStore, delving into ongoing competition issues including those related to Apple Music. Her meeting with Alphabet and Google&#39;s Sundar Pichai focused on the design of choice screens, the company&#39;s self-preferencing practices in relation to the DMA, and the Google adtech antitrust case. These interactions underline the EU&#39;s commitment to regulating major tech companies, defining their roles and responsibilities as &#34;gatekeepers&#34; under the DMA. This includes making their messaging apps interoperable and giving users more control over app installations. The specifics of Vestager&#39;s discussion with Qualcomm&#39;s Cristiano Amon were not detailed, but she emphasized the broader economic and security significance of chip technology in the EU. These high-level meetings are critical in shaping the operations of tech companies within the EU, ensuring they align with the region&#39;s digital strategy and competition laws."
